# Survival
The 2D world is represented by a 2D grid of 8x8 squares (2d Array) each square contains a creature in it or not. 
All the creatures are safe in the world given these conditions;
The world is divided into rows, columns and diagonals.
There are exactly 8 creatures in the world. All creatures must be able to survive. 
They can only survive if no creature can “see” another. For them to survive there must be exactly one creature in each row and exactly one creature in each column, and at most one creature in the 30 diagonals.
